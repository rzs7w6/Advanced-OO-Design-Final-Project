# Do the languages support Procedural Programming?

## C# (sharp)

* C# is not a procedural programming language according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Procedural_programming_languages), and does not cleanly allow for procedural programming.  A procedural style can be mimicked, but not easily.

## Ruby

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) states that "Ruby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), with object orientation . . . or functional programming."

* Ruby supports procedural programming, but not purely procedural programming as would be found in true procedural languages.
